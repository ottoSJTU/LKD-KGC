expression browser
the expression browser is available at `/graph` on the prometheus server, allowing you
to enter any expression and see its result either in a table or graphed over time.
this is primarily useful for ad-hoc queries and debugging. for graphs, use
[grafana](/docs/visualization/grafana/) or [console templates](/docs/visualization/consoles/).
